## ðŸ›  Motivation and Impact
This project was developed during my role as an **SI Leader** at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Its primary goal was to streamline administrative workflows and improve efficiency in tracking attendance for Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions.

By automating repetitive tasks, the attendance tracker:
- Reduced manual data entry time by over 50%.
- Enhanced the accuracy and consistency of attendance records for over 40 students.
- Allowed me to focus more on mentoring and supporting students during sessions, rather than administrative work.

This tool exemplifies how leveraging Python and Excel integration can solve real-world efficiency challenges in educational settings.
